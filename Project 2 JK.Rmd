## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
df_orig<-read_csv("/Users/jonathan/Documents/GitHub/DATS6101_Project-1/Tables/project2_data.csv")
str(df_orig)
df_orig$state<-as.factor(df_orig$state)
df_orig$year<-as.factor(df_orig$year)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r}
par(mfrow = c(2, 2))
hist(x=df_orig$birthstotal)
```

```{r}
model1<-lm(pregnancies1519~ state+abstinence+pregnancyrate1519, data=df_orig)
summary(model1)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
